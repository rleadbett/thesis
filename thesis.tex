\part{Lifetime analysis}\label{part:one}

In this first part of the thesis, I look at the problem of analysing the partially observed lifetime data of repeatedly replaced components. That is, when a component has been repeatedly replaced for many years, but the failure records are only available from a particular date up to the present. In these cases, the first observed failure of each component is the end of a lifetime with an unknown start time, and the most recent replacement marks the beginning of a lifetime, which we have not yet observed the end of. The idler frame data introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:industry-data} is an example of this type of problem.

The work in this part was motivated by an industry project to inform the fixed time replacement interval in a preventative maintenance policy for the idlers in the frames using data such as that in Sec.~\ref{sec:industry-data}. My initial approach to modelling such data was published as a conference paper \textit{Informative Bayesian Survival Analysis to Handle Heavy Censoring in Lifetime Data} (the full citation is provided at the beginning of the thesis on p.~vii). However, since the initial approach was published, I have taken an alternative approach to the problem, which I present in Chap.~\ref{chap:chapter2}. In Chap.~\ref{chap:chapter3}, I apply the newly proposed approach to the idler-frame data and demonstrate how the analysis can inform preventative maintenance policy. Parts of the original conference paper still make up a portion of the background material in both Chaps.~\ref{chap:chapter2} and~\ref{chap:chapter3}.

\part{Degradation modelling}\label{part:two}

In this second part of the thesis, I focus on degradation modelling, primarily using the gamma stochastic process. Many of the degradation datasets provided by the Centre's industry partners were contaminated with noise and had few repeated measures for each asset/component in the dataset; the belt wear dataset is an example of this. The gamma process is suitable for modelling these types of degradation datasets. For example, in the belt wear data, degradation occurs in small jumps as ore is loaded onto the belt. However, before the gamma process could be applied to these datasets, I needed to understand to extend it to incorporate noise; understand its properties; implement it in stan; and any computational issues.

In the first chapter of Part~\ref{part:two}, Chap.~\ref{chap:chapter4}, I demonstrate how the gamma process can be extended to incorporate noisy degradation measurements through Bayesian hierarchical modelling for a single noisy degradation trace. Then, in Chap.~\ref{chap:chapter5}, I show how the proposed noisy gamma process model can be applied to multiple units, allowing for unit-to-unit variability (which facilitates the borrowing of information between units). The works in these two foundational chapters have been submitted for publication as the manuscript \textit{Bayesian hierarchical modelling of noisy gamma processes: model formulation, identifiability, model fitting, and extensions to unit-to-unit variability} to Applied Models in Business and Industry. However, Chaps.~\ref{chap:chapter4} and~\ref{chap:chapter5} provide more details about model checking, computation, and diagnostics than the manuscript submitted for publication.

In Chap.~\ref{chap:chapter6}, I apply the noisy gamma process to the belt wear data introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:industry-data} by combining it with functional data analysis. The work in Chap.~\ref{chap:chapter6} has been prepared as a manuscript titled \textit{Functional degradation modelling of the wearing surface of conveyor belting using Bayesian hierarchical modelling and Gamma processes}. It is planned for submission to the Annals of Applied Statistics. In addition to the work presented in the manuscript, Chap.~\ref{chap:chapter6} provides a side-by-side comparison of the gamma process-based belt wear model from the manuscript with a linear general path-based model. The full citations for the e-prints of the manuscripts are provided at the beginning of the thesis (p.~vii).
