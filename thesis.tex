\part{Part two: Degradation modelling}\label{part:two}

In this second part of the thesis, I focus on degradation modelling---primarily using the gamma stochastic process. The more foundational work in this second half of the thesis---chapters~\ref{chap:chapter4} and~\ref{chap:chapter5}---arose out of necessity to apply the gamma process to industry data from the Centre's industry partners. Particularly, the work was motivated by two applied problems: modelling the degradation of many pipe spools in a bauxite processing plant and modelling the wear of an overland iron ore conveyor's belt---the latter was in one of my industry placements. The pipe degradation project, undertaken by Â Gabriel Gonz\'{a}lez Caceres and Aloke Phatak, looked at the degradation in wall thickness of pipe spools. The gamma process should theoretically be a good model for the erosion of the inside of the spools. However, the degradation signals for each spool are very noisy and consist of only a few measurements; therefore, there was a need to accommodate noise in the gamma process model and to borrow information between similar units in order to estimate the parameters of the model. The belt wear project was an industry placement where I was asked to analyse the belt wear of all conveyors at an industry partner mine, processing facility, and port and devise a better method for modelling belt wear. To analyse the many wear profiles, I used functional data analysis techniques. This led to taking the same approach when modelling the belts' degradation. The gamma process should also be a good model for the degradation of the belt since the degradation mechanism is wear. However, similar to the pipe spool problem, the signals of the spline coefficients were noisy and sparsely observed.

In the first chapter of this part, chapter~\ref{chap:chapter4}, I demonstrate how the gamma process can be extended to incorporate noisy degradation measurements through Bayesian hierarchical modelling. Then, in chapter~\ref{chap:chapter5}, I show how unit-to-unit variability (which facilitates the borrowing of information between units) can be included in the proposed noisy gamma process model. The work in these two chapters has been submitted for publication as the manuscript \textit{``Bayesian hierarchical modelling of noisy gamma processes: model formulation, identifiability, model fitting, and extensions to unit-to-unit variability''} to Applied Models in Business and Industry. The chapters present an expansion of the manuscript by tying the supplementary material submitted alongside the manuscript into the main analysis and discussion and providing a deeper discussion of the two main topics. There is also a larger focus on the computational details of the analysis.

In chapter~\ref{chap:chapter6}, I present the belt wear model developed as part of the belt wear industry placement, which utilises the noisy gamma process model. The work in chapter~\ref{chap:chapter6} has been submitted for publication to the Annals of Applied Statistics as the manuscript \textit{``Functional degradation modelling of the wearing surface of conveyor belting using Bayesian hierarchical modelling and Gamma processes''}. In addition to the work presented in the manuscript, chapter~\ref{chap:chapter6} provides a side-by-side comparison of the gamma process-based belt wear model from the manuscript with a linear general path-based model.
