  abstract       = {A key sticking point of Bayesian analysis is the choice of prior distribution, and there is a vast literature on potential defaults including uniform priors, Jeffreys’ priors, reference priors, maximum entropy priors, and weakly informative priors. These methods, however, often manifest a key conceptual tension in prior modeling: a model encoding true prior information should be chosen without reference to the model of the measurement process, but almost all common prior modeling techniques are implicitly motivated by a reference likelihood. In this paper we resolve this apparent paradox by placing the choice of prior into the context of the entire Bayesian analysis, from inference to prediction to model evaluation.},

  abstract  = {A subject is left-truncated when it comes under observation after having been exposed to the risk of an event for some time. Left-truncated subjects tend to have lower risks at shorter durations than those in a normal sample because high-risk subjects tend to experience the event and drop out before reaching the point at which observation begins. When start times are unknown, left truncation is practically intractable unless the hazard rate is constant or all left-truncated subjects are discarded. When start times are known, left-truncated data can be handled by the conditional likelihood approach. The critical information on the start time of a left-truncated subject can be frequently obtained from human subjects. The concentration of covariate information in the observation period in a longitudinal social survey is well-suited for the conditional approach. We show that a piece-wise exponential hazard model and a discrete-time model based on the conditional likelihood approach can be readily estimated by extant packages like SAS. We also describe an alternative conditional partial likelihood approach. An empirical example of marital dissolution in the United States is provided.},

  abstract = {Especially when facing reliability data with limited information (e.g., a small number of failures), there are strong motivations for using Bayesian inference methods. These include the option to use information from physics-of-failure or previous experience with a failure mode in a particular material to specify an informative prior distribution. Another advantage is the ability to make statistical inferences without having to rely on specious (when the number of failures is small) asymptotic theory needed to justify non-Bayesian methods. Users of non-Bayesian methods are faced with multiple methods of constructing uncertainty intervals (Wald, likelihood, and various bootstrap methods) that can give substantially different answers when there is little information in the data. For Bayesian inference, there is only one method of constructing equal-tail credible intervals—but it is necessary to provide a prior distribution to fully specify the model. Much work has been done to find default prior distributions that will provide inference methods with good (and in some cases exact) frequentist coverage properties. This paper reviews some of this work and provides, evaluates, and illustrates principled extensions and adaptations of these methods to the practical realities of reliability data (e.g., non-trivial censoring).},

The experience of users shows that the majority of belt damages are due to improper operation of the conveyor or the technical condition of components. The article presents an overview of the types of belt damages and the authors' classification of their causes, not directly related to the quality of production of the belt itself. For each type of damage, the right method of prevention and condition monitoring is presented.

  abstract = {Abstract In field reliability analyses, a data collection period is given to monitor the failure events from the field. Left-truncation arises due to early failures occurring before the data collection period, and right-censoring arises for late failures occurring beyond the monitoring period. Naïve analyses of left-truncated and right-censored data lead to biased estimation of the population lifetime of interest. A variety of models and methods have been developed to analyze the left-truncated and right-censored data for field reliability analyses. The goal of the paper is to review the existing models and methods for fitting left-truncated and right-censored data. Our review includes the existing statistical models, such as the exponential, Weibull, lognormal, gamma, Gompertz, Lomax, and spline models. We comprehensively review the statistical issues of maximum likelihood estimation, model selection, residual lifetime prediction, and Bayesian methods. Some of these methods are illustrated through the field reliability analysis of the electric power transformer dataset.},
