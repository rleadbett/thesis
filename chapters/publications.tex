A portion of the work in this thesis has been published or is in the process of being published. The groundwork for Chaps.~\ref{chap:chapter2} and~\ref{chap:chapter3} on heavily censored lifetime data was published as \cite{leadbetter2021}[1]. However, Chaps.~\ref{chap:chapter2} and~\ref{chap:chapter3} present an alternative approach to the original manuscript. The work in Chaps.~\ref{chap:chapter4} and~\ref{chap:chapter5} focussing on the noisy gamma process has been published as \cite{leadbetter2024}[2] and the work in Chap.~\ref{chap:chapter6} on conveyor belt wear will be submitted as \cite{leadbetter2025}[3].
