\chapter*{Acknowledgement of Country} \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgement of Country}

In the spirit of reconciliation, I acknowledge and pay my deepest respect to the Traditional Owners of the land on which this research was conducted, the Whadjuk people of the Noongar Nation, whose ancestral lands Curtin University is built upon. I also wish to acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the lands I have been fortunate enough to travel on during my PhD, and their enduring connections to land, sea, and community. I pay my respects to their Elders, past and present. This always was, and always will be, Aboriginal land.
