\chapter{Introduction: Bayesian reliability modelling}\label{chap:chapter1}

Introduction to reliability modelling and the theme of the thesis; which is reliability modelling in the `real world`.

\section{Asset health management?}

Do I need to talk about replacement strategies?

\section{Reliability modelling}

General introduction to reliability data is SMRD2 Meeker, Escobar, and Pascual and a good bridge between lifetime data and degradation modelling is Bayesian Reliability Hamada, Wilson, Reese, and Martz.

\paragraph*{Lifetime data}

Definition of lifetime analysis.

\paragraph*{Degradation data}

Definition of degradation modelling.

\section{Bayesian methods and workflow}

An overview of Bayesian methods.

Probably also some discourse on the Bayesian workflow.

\subsection{Simulation for model checking}

An ongoing thread through the thesis is the concept of using simulated date from a known underlying truth to assess model performance\ldots
