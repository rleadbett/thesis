%First and foremost, to my primary supervisor, Aloke Phatak. Thank you for your guidance and mentorship. It has been an honour. Being witness to your rigour, passion, kindness, and thirst for knowledge has changed me fundamentally.

%I would also like to thank my co-supervisors: Michael Small and Chris Aldrich (and for a short time Darfiana Nur).

%My PhD was supported by the Center for Transforming Maintenance through Data Science (CTMTDS), for which I am extremely grateful. Thank you to all of the passionate and brilliant people who make CTMTDS what it is: a community. And to the person whom made it that most, Natasha Barlett, I have never seen someone go so above and beyond their job description. Thank you for being a mentor and friend, for always having an open door for me or anyone else (not that you had much of a choice in an open plan office), and for always checking in.

%To my 216 office mates Sandy, Gabriel, Yingying, Ponpot, and Srimali, your fellowship\dots It is the friends like you that make\dots : the lunch chats; the coffee rants; the travel adventures; the pub celebrations.

%To my two `unoficial' UWA supervisors, Melinda and Adriano, 

%To the small Bayesian community at Curtin, Arash, Suman, Zanglong, and Shih Ching\dots

%To my industry collaborators,\dots Thank you for seeing the value in academic research and investing your most valuable currency to it: your time.

%To Saf and Hutch, thank you for your enthusiasm to contribute to the practical side of this Thesis. Hutch, getting to go up to site and get hands on with the conveyors with you was invaluable in the applied component of the work contained in these pages.

%To my family, Anne, Russ, and Ellie. This Thesis would not only not exist without your support, but I would not have even attempted it. Your love and support is bottomless, I am truly blessed. Dad and Ellie, 
%And Mum,\dots Instilling me with a passion for science and research.

%Lastly, to Jody,
