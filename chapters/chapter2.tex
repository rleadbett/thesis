\chapter{Heavily censored lifetime data: part 1}\label{chap:chapter2}

General introductory part.

\section{Background}

Interlude.

\subsection{Lifetime analysis}

What is lifetime analysis.

\subsection{The Weibull distribution}

Details of the Weibull.

\subsection{Censoring}

What is Censoring?

\section{Bias in heavily censored lifetime data}

Introduce the problem that, when data are heavily censored, the estimates of lifetime parameters become bias. We will show via simulated data so that the underlying truth is known.

\subsection{Simulation method}

How do we simulate censored lifetime data?

\subsection{Bias in results}

How does the estimated CDF differ from the truth?

\section{Informative Bayesian analysis}

How can informative priors help us in this case?

\paragraph*{Independent}

Construction of independent priors.

\paragraph*{Joint}

Construction of the joint prior.

\subsection{Effect of informative priors}

Compare the estimated CDF for the three different models with the truth.

\section{Discussion}
