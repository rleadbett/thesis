# Thesis

This thesis summarises the work done during my industry linked PhD. The PhD was done at the [Center for Transforming Maintenance Through Data Science](https://www.maintenance.org.au/display/PUBLIC) (CTMTDS); a partnership between Curtin University, University of WA, and CSIRO and the mining companies Alcoa, BHP, and Roy Hill. The centre is part funded by the Australian Research Council and part funded by the industry partners. The over arching theme of the thesis is useful (and novel) examples of Bayesian model building for reliability modelling in industrial settings.

## The origin story

My PhD sits under [Theme 2](https://www.maintenance.org.au/display/PUBLIC/Theme+2%3A+Support+the+Engineer#) of the CTMTDS, who's goal is to support the engineer. Therefore, the foundational goal of my PhD thesis was to assist engineers in maintenance decision making by building statistical models for their industry data. Throughout my PhD I have had to undertake a number of industry placements within the industry partners to identify and work on problems which are relevant to them and the wider mining industry. The purpose of embedding these placements within the PhD was to direct the final body of work to be more applied and industry relevant. Initially we proposed large sophisticated models for summarising the reliability of entire complex assets. However, we quickly found that there was more fundamental problems that had to be tackled first due to the messiness and noise in observational industry data sets. Many of the assets where maintenance bottlenecks were present-and hence statistical modelling would have the biggest impact-either had small amounts of data with small signal to noise ratios or large datasets with very messy/incomplete data collection. In these cases, the main reason that maintenance decision making was so difficult was the maintainer's uncertainty resulting from them trying to understand complex processes through flawed data. This conclusion naturally focussed my PhD on filling the gaps necessary to translate robust statistical modelling methods in the reliability literature over to these messy industrial settings so that the maintainer's have a formal framework to quantify the uncertainty in these difficult maintenance decisions.

## Structure and flow

The body of the thesis is broken into two parts, which are unified by an introductory section and a general discussion/concluding section. At the beginning of each part, I've included a preamble that provides a background on the industry placement project/s that motivated the work contained in the part and points out which chapters have been published or submitted for publication. I hope that these short sections of metadiscourse provide a glimpse into the extra work that has gone into defining novel research problems who's solutions are truly useful to the reliability practitioners in industry.

In the introductory section at the beginning of the thesis, I introduce the primary and subordinate conceptual threads that run throughout the body of work, and paint the picture of how the different parts in the thesis tie together as a whole, coherent, piece of work. The primary recurrent themes of the thesis that are laid out in the introduction are reliability modelling/health management, and Bayesian statistics and model building. The unifying topping of the thesis is health management, something that is informed by Reliability modelling, reliability modelling has two general classes, lifetime analysis and degradation modelling (there is a reference somewhere for this) which is the topic of the two parts of this thesis.
