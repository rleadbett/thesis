\caption{\label{tab:cp}Output from fitting a model with complete pooling to the noisy data of Fig.~\ref{fig:crack-growth-w-noise}. We assume that the data from all units is a manifestation of a single underlying gamma process, and hence the mean and coefficient of variation of the process do not vary from unit-to-unit.}
